summary: "Embarking on my first web development project, the creation of Guardian, a bot designed to automate tasks within my game community, was a comedic journey filled with lessons learned‚Äîfrom the mysterious antics of the initial iteration, CatBot, to navigating the complexities of websockets, TypeScript, and managing changes across dual languages."

Web development is a thrilling adventure, but let‚Äôs not forget the humor in the chaos. As any seasoned developer will tell you, users have a magical ability to find ways to break things‚Äîsometimes in ways you never thought possible. My initiation into this world began with the first iteration of Guardian, initially dubbed ‚ÄúCatBot.‚Äù Little did I know that within a couple of hours of deploying CatBot, my community members would manage to break it beyond recognition. To this day, the mysterious catastrophe remains unsolved, and I‚Äôve lovingly embraced the art of hitting the reset button and starting over. Thanks, Kit ü•≤ü•≤

Despite the murder of my beloved CatBot, the journey to create Guardian proved to be an enlightening experience. Designed to handle user applications, interviews, and whitelisting processes within my game community, Guardian became a testament to the resilience and adaptability required in web development. It is now a critical tool in how we manage our community members and I am currently in development of a major upgrade and potential product to release for other server admins to use. Thanks Pook for letting me break stuff ‚ù§Ô∏è

## Web Sockets
Honestly, I still haven't wrapped my head around this concept fully yet. I know what it is and why you may need to use it, but the underlying implementation is still a bit tedious and foreign to me‚Äîcries in read and write buffers. This one particular section, which was responsible for sending and listening for events from my server, took me a while to understand. At the time, I only had a few months of experience programming, and it was confusing why I could not read or parse the data without it coming out like a garbled mess on the other end. Thankfully, though, Socket.IO removed this concern for me and is the main reason why I use JavaScript instead of inserting x language here just because I could understand the docs more. It was a good substitute in the meantime just so I can get a working project out without making me want to burn the whole thing down in one glorious flame pit.

## Jumping Into Typescript
I once saw a video on YouTube from [Theo](https://www.youtube.com/@t3dotgg) which pretty much went typescript good, javascript less good, and I took that and just sped off to the races with typescript. Did I even know javascript? Hell no, never used it in my life, but because this was a very successful engineer, I was like he must be right. So was he? Personally, I think yes, but if you asked me back when I was doing the project, absolutely not. This whole types and enforcing it caused me to want to scream many times because I didn't understand how types worked or when and how to use them. Making it extremely annoying trying to follow a guide at the time, which is, in itself, a problem, in javascript and getting all these type errors. I finally took the time to go watch a crash course on TypeScript and was able to understand enough to get this cobbled piece of mess together just so I can get feedback.

## Finale
It went exactly how you expected, a whole lot of errors and many nights confused on why something isn't working. Turns out when you are a new dev and you try to learn a language from scratch not knowing why you are using certain things it can get pretty bad really quickly. Thankfully, now that I have some more experience, I can laugh at my mistakes and appreciate the journey that I have been on as a dev.

To any new developers out there, I leave this message: You will fail MANY times; even after X decades, you will fail. But the point is to always learn from your failures and try to understand fully WHY you are using something. Theo did go through why typescript, in his view, is worth the investment of typings, but to be honest, I did not even understand it after that video and was just like he said it's good so I'ma use it. Do I regret anything that I have done? No, but I would not advise people to take the same route that I took; it could become very discouraging. I am, by nature, a trial by fire person. I jump in and just see what works and what doesn't. And it also helps that I am willing to just burn the entire project down and start over again; I think I need to get that checked out. Either way, happy coding!
